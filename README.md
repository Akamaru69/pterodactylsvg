TemuxOS SVG Icon Login
Instalação do script:
To put your new pterodactyl.svg in place of the pterodactyl.svg that already comes in the script and needs to be in .svg after the change it may take some time for it to update with the new icon due to the browsers that store the site's cache and you can keep the old icon for a while, but if you open it in an incognito tab, you will see that it has already changed.

```sh
bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CatValentine-Dev/pterodactylsvg/main/installsvg.sh)
```
